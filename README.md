# Used-Car-Analysis-Dashboard
A comprehensive data analysis and interactive dashboard project that explores pricing trends, depreciation patterns, transmission distribution, and model-wise performance in the used car market.
This project transforms raw used car data into meaningful business insights using data analytics and visualization techniques.

## Project Objective
To analyze used car data and identify key factors influencing resale value, market demand trends, and depreciation behavior to support data-driven pricing decisions.

## Key Dashboard Metrics
| Metric                 | Value      |
| ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Total Cars             | 11K        |
| Average Price          | $22.7K     |
| Highest Price          | $123.46K   |
| Average Car Age        | 8.92 Years |
| Average Mileage        | 25.50K     |
| Average Engine Size    | 2.2L       |
| Highest Engine Variant | 6.6L       |

## Key Analysis & Insights
### 1️.Engine Capacity vs Market Price
Strong positive relationship between engine size and selling price
Premium engine variants (e.g., 6.6L) command significantly higher resale value
Engine capacity acts as a primary price driver

Business Insight: High-performance engine variants maintain premium positioning in the resale market.

### 2️.Model-wise Average Selling Price
Top-performing models by average resale value:
X7 – $69.84K
8 Series – $64.00K
M5 – $57.76K
i8 – $57.01K

Business Insight: Luxury and performance-oriented models retain higher market value.

### 3️.Price Growth Trend (1998–2020)
Stable pricing in early years
Noticeable growth post-2015
Sharp increase approaching 2020

Business Insight: Increasing demand for newer vehicles drives upward price trends.

### 4️.Depreciation Analysis (Price vs Mileage)
Clear negative correlation between mileage and price
Higher mileage vehicles show consistent price decline
Downward regression trend confirms predictable depreciation behavior

Business Insight: Mileage is a critical variable in valuation modeling and price forecasting.

### 5️.Transmission Distribution
Semi-Automatic: 42%
Automatic: 35%
Manual: 23%

Business Insight: Automatic and semi-automatic vehicles dominate resale demand, indicating shifting consumer preference
